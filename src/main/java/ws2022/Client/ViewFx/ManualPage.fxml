Place the five covers overfive discs. As you place each cover say something like “The tree is under the orange disc”.All players pay attention to this part and watch and listen to remember which pictures are where. The first player throws the die. The color he gets will indicate the color of cover he will he lifting. If he gets the joker he can lift any cover. Let’s pretend the player got an orangeon the die. Before lifting the cover, the player must announce the image that is under thecover, saying something like ”Under the orange cover is the tree”. . If he is correct, he takesthe disc and sets it by his place (to be counted at the end of the game). He then takes thecover and puts it on any disc left in the grid, announcing what he is covering and the colorof the cover. His turn is over. If he is incorrect, he has to leave the disc there, re-cover it,and the next player throws the die for their turn. The game will end when there are onlyfour discs left in the grid and there is nowhere to place the fifth cover. Player with the mostdiscs at this point is the winner." wrappingWidth="508.75323486328125">
