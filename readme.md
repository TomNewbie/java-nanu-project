## Introduction

Nanu is a memory game for children. There are 24 pictures, 2-5 covers in the game. At the beginnig, the covers are put on random pictures. The players will roll the dice and try to remember which picture hidden under the color rolled cover.
In this repository, we created the java game based on the original nanu game. We implemented most of the basis features and rules of the game. In our game, there are two mode: online and offline. Offline version is just a two-player game, where the players take turn to roll dice and guess the picture. While in the online version, you can play on multiple machines if you enter the secret code.
